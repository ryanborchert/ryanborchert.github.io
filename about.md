# About Ryan

<img src="/assets/images/headshot.jpg" alt="Ryan Borchert, Engineering Director in Ann Arbor" style="width: 250px; border-radius: 8px; float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;">

I'm an engineering director and software engineering leader based in Ann Arbor, Michigan, with nearly two decades of experience in agile transformation, DevOps implementation, and building high-performance engineering teams that deliver scalable software solutions. My career spans from hands-on software development to strategic leadership roles, with a consistent focus on transforming engineering organizations and driving measurable business outcomes.

## Engineering Leadership Philosophy

As an engineering director specializing in team leadership and organizational transformation, I believe great software engineering leaders serve their teams by removing obstacles, providing clear direction, and fostering environments where talented people can do their best work. My approach centers on:

- **People-First Leadership**: Developing talent through mentorship, coaching, and creating growth opportunities
- **Operational Excellence**: Implementing proven methodologies (Agile, Lean, DevOps) to deliver faster and more reliably  
- **Strategic Alignment**: Ensuring technical decisions support broader business objectives
- **Continuous Improvement**: Using data-driven insights to optimize processes and outcomes

## Software Engineering Background

My engineering leadership experience is built on a strong technical foundation spanning enterprise software development (C#/.NET, C/C++, Python), automation & control systems, embedded systems, and cloud platforms. This hands-on experience in software engineering helps me make informed architectural decisions and maintain credibility with engineering teams.

## Career Highlights

**Current Role**: As Director of Engineering at OPUS IVS, I've led agile transformations that reduced delivery cycles by 20%, implemented DevOps practices that cut deployment time in half, and built efficient workflows for globally distributed software teams.

**Previous Leadership**: At Balance Technology Inc, I directed engineering and operations for $30M+ in annual sales, led the development of automation systems for automotive and aerospace clients, and established strategic partnerships that captured millions in new business with companies like Lucid and Rivian.

**Growth Trajectory**: My path from Sr. Software Engineer to engineering management roles (including a promotion to Department Manager in just 9 months at New Eagle) demonstrates both technical depth and software engineering leadership capability.

## Education & Certifications

- **B.S. Electrical Engineering**, Lake Superior State University (2005)
- **ISO 26262 Automotive Functional Safety** Certification

## Beyond Work

I'm passionate about emerging technologies, continuous learning, and contributing to the software engineering community. I believe in the power of technology to solve meaningful problems and am always looking for opportunities to apply innovative solutions to real-world challenges.
